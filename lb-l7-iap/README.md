# Load Balancer L7 with Identity-Aware Proxy

## Note

In this example, IAP is configured on the load balancer backend service. However, you can also enable IAP directly on Cloud Run services, which is recommended for this architecture. (As of September 2025, this feature is still in preview.) For more details, see the official documentation below:
